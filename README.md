# Wealth-inequality-and-Political-Violence
Project focused on finding the correlation between the level of wealth inequality in a nation and the level of political violence that occurs, accounting for a possible confounding variable being religious/ethnic tension. GINI coefficents were used to identify the level of welath ineqaulity. 2018 was the year for all data sets due to having the most countries having a reported GINI coefficent at 84 countries. Rstudio was used primarily for data cleaning, transforming, and statistical analysis that includes correlation tests, tests for normality, scatterplots, and a multiple linear regression. Excel was also utilized to aid in data cleaning and transforming.
